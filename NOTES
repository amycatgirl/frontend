# Notes

Wherever we are using "menu generator", chances are we should just move the component into interface.
Context menu needs to be more broadly available (in interface package?)

# Good to do but not necessary

- separate invite background
- check what we are missing from competitors in ctx menus
- Image preview modal prolly (this will be annoying to not have to users)
- Store unsent messages in Draft (keep files around until send)

# To-do

- Style the message "bars": reply, attached, last read message, auto complete
- not sure whether to polish up all message components
- fix all the auth flows
- shift + click mention user

# Ask about

- right side padding on messages

# In Progress

- Modals "edit identity"
- Redesign login page
- confirm reports
- report menu should say it goes to team

# Done

- right click mention user
- Modals "kick member", "ban member", "report user"
- pressing enter in modal does not close it [BUG]
- [BUG] deleting server has weird behaviour
- [BUG] missing user for new members joining server
- Modals "delete X", "leave server", "delete channel"
- Fix colours for offline members in list
- Fix colours for hovering / mentions messages in chat
