# Notes

Wherever we are using "menu generator", chances are we should just move the component into interface.
Context menu needs to be more broadly available (in interface package?)

# To-do

- Modals "edit identity", "leave server", "delete channel", "kick member", "ban member", "report user"
- Store unsent messages in Draft (keep files around until send)
- Fix colours for offline members in list
- Fix colours for hovering / mentions messages in chat
- Style the message "bars": reply, attached, last read message, auto complete
- Redesign login page
- Image preview modal prolly
- separate invite background
